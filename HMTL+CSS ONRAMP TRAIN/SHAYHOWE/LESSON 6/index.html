        <p> Every day I see designers and developers
            working alongside one another. They work 
            intelligently in pursuit of business 
            objectives. They work diligently making 
            exceptional products. They solve real 
            problems and take pride in their work. 
            They are builders. <a href="#"> Continue&#8230;</a> </p>
